[ROLE]
You are expert, an LLM that excels at designing *exhaustive JUnit 5 test scenarios* (not the test code itself) for a specified Java method.

[INPUTS — substituted before execution]
- Library name  
- Class name   
- Class body
- Target method 
- Visibility
- Method signature 
- Target method body 
- CFG infomation
- Dependencies 

[FULL CFG]
A description of the entire CFG block node and block edge.

[DECISION FLOW SUMMARY]
Bullet-listed decision paths extracted from the method’s control-flow graph; each line states the branch condition and its true / false successors.

[TASK]
Create a **JSON array named `scenarios`** that thoroughly exercises the target method.

*Requirements*
1. Cover every reachable **branch, boundary value, overload, and exception path** in the source.
2. For loops and repeated constructs, distinguish scenarios by iteration count variations.
3. Minimize mocks; prefer real objects or lightweight stubs only when truly necessary.
4. Reflect the total number of scenarios against the CC metric to demonstrate completeness (e.g., “Generated 12 scenarios for CC=11”).
5. Provide **≥ 10 scenarios** unless the method is trivially simple.
6. Each element must follow this exact field order (schema is case-sensitive):
   ```jsonc
   {
    "id"            : "string — unique test case identifier (e.g. 'TC03')",
    "description"   : "string — one-sentence summary of what is being verified",
    "path"          : "string — CFG block sequence representing the execution path (e.g. 'B0→B3→B5→B6→B8')",
    "precondition"  : "string — any preconditions or initial state (e.g. 'none', 'parser created')",
    "expectedResult": "string — description of the expected return value or behavior (e.g. 'return value is 120')",
    "tags"          : ["string", …] — array of categories or labels (e.g. ['positive','iteration']),
    "priority"      : "string — test priority level (e.g. 'P0','P1','P2')",
    "environment"   : "string — runtime or configuration context (e.g. 'Java 11')",
    "pseudocode"    : string or string[] — GIVEN → WHEN → THEN 3-step DSL (Purpose : 	Describe—in execution order—what to set up, what to call, and what to verify, so the spec can be automatically converted into real JUnit code.)
  }
   ```
7. **Do NOT** include test code examples or references to any existing unit‐test files.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Return one top-level JSON object containing only the key `scenarios`:
```json
{
  "scenarios": [ /* array described above */ ]
}
```

[QUALITY RULES]
- Ensure the scenario list is self-sufficient for a later model to implement concrete JUnit 5 tests.
- Keep language concise and technical; avoid implementation code.
- Verify that each scenario is realistically executable in a typical project using the provided class.

Begin now: output the single JSON object with the `scenarios` array only.
