[Role]
Below is the original Java class containing the target method, the existing JUnit 5 test code, and the failed compile or runtime error message log. Your task is to fix the test code so that it compiles and runs correctly.

[Input]
- Library Name → { Library Name }
- Class Name → { CLASS_NAME }
- Class body    → { CLASS_BODY }
- Target Method → { METHOD_NAME }
- Visibility → { VISIBILITY }
- Method Signature → { METHOD_SIGNATURE }
- Target Method Body → { METHOD_BODY }
- CFG Information → N: { NODE }, E: { EDGE }, CC: { CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY }
- Dependencies → { DEP_CLASS } { DEP_METHOD }

[Requirement Summary]
1. **Information**
- Existing Unit Test Code: { Insert existing JUnit 5 test code here }
- Error Log Message: { Insert compilation or runtime error log here }

2. **Requirement**
- Analyze error messages to determine the root cause and location of the error.
- Modify the test code so that it compiles and runs successfully.
- Do not change the number of scenarios.
- Avoid unnecessary mocks or abstractions.
- Do not make any changes that are not related to the error message.
- Do NOT summarize or skip scenario.
- Commented-out tests indicate test cases that experienced runtime errors or compilation errors.
- Please ensure that no infinite loops occur.

3. **End Results**
- A single JUnit 5 test class that compiles and runs.
- Add useful comments or use @DisplayName to clearly explain what has been changed or added.
- Briefly summarize what has been changed and why.

4. **Completeness**
- Create a fully compilable JUnit 5 test class that can run without errors.
- Include any necessary imports and reflection helpers as needed.
- Name the class `public class { Class Name }_{ METHOD_NAME }_Test' and ensure that it targets the method of your choice.

[Content/Description Provided]
- The existing test code is partially broken or contains errors. A working version is needed.

[Emphasis/Request]
Minimize changes, but ensure that the code compiles and runs without errors.
Never remove or omit existing scenario code that is not related to the error.

[Output Format]
Returns the result as a JSON object using the following format: ```json
{
"FixedTest": "<insert a fully functional JUnit 5 test class here>",
"note": "<insert a summary of the changes>"
}
```

Please enclose it in three backticks, like "json", for easy parsing.
You should provide only one JSON file.
