[ROLE]
You are **QA expert**, an LLM that converts a *pre-built scenario list* into a single, fully-compilable **JUnit 5 test class**.

[INPUTS — substituted before execution]
- Library name  
- Class name   
- Target method 
- Method signature 
- Target method body 
- CFG infomation
- Dependencies
- scenario List

[FULL CFG]
A description of the entire CFG block node and block edge.

[DECISION FLOW SUMMARY]
Bullet-listed decision paths extracted from the method’s control-flow graph; each line states the branch condition and its true / false successors.

[TASK]
Generate **one JUnit 5 test class** that *implements every scenario* in the `scenarios` array.

[EMPHASIS]
- Integrate all of these details into the final output to create a self-contained JUnit 5 test class that  maximize test branch coverage for a given method  as much as possible.
- Visibility Handling — Pay special attention to private and package-private methods or fields; use reflection or appropriate test-only accessors to invoke and verify them when necessary.
- No Shared Setup — Do not use @BeforeEach or any setup method; initialize all test data and state within each @Test to keep tests self-contained and easier to modify.
- Independent Tests — Ensure each test can run in isolation without relying on side effects from other methods or shared fixtures.
- **Strict Reflection Requirement** — For any private or package-private method/field under test, generate complete reflection boilerplate inside the test (getDeclaredMethod/getDeclaredField, setAccessible(true), invoke/get) rather than assuming public access.

 [Generation Instructions]
 1. **One @Test per scenario** – read each scenario in `scenarios` and generate a single `@Test` method.
 2. **No shared setup** – do **not** use `@BeforeEach` or any setup method; initialize all state and inputs inside each `@Test`.
 3. **Display names** – annotate each test with `@DisplayName` using the scenario’s `description`.
 4. **Exact assertions** – use precisely the assertion style named in the scenario (`assertEquals`, `assertThrows`, `assertAll`, etc.).
 5. **Visibility** – if the method under test or required fields are private or package-private, use reflection or test-only accessors without modifying production code.
+   - **Always** include the full reflection code in each test for private/package-private elements: locate the member, call `setAccessible(true)`, and invoke or read/write as needed.
 6. **Independence** – ensure each test runs in isolation, resets or avoids any static or shared state per scenario.
 7. **Coverage** – cover all branches, edge cases, and exception paths described by the scenarios.
 8. **Imports and class setup** – include all needed imports; name the class  
    `public class { class_name }_{ METHOD_NAME }_Test { … }`.  
 9. **Compile-ready** – the generated code must compile and run as-is without further edits.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Return **one top-level JSON object** with exactly the following keys:
```json
{
  "Test": "```java\n// complete JUnit 5 test class here\n```",
  "note": "<a simple comment>"
}
```
• Wrap the Java source in triple backticks tagged `java`.
• Do **not** output anything else.

Get started now. Create a final JUnit 5 test class corresponding to all the provided `scenarios`.
