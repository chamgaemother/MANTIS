Got it—I’m ready to dive in.
I’ll need:
    1. The original Java class (or at least the method you’re targeting).
    2. The current JUnit 5 test class that’s failing.
    3. The exact compilation or runtime error log you’re seeing.

With those three pieces, I’ll return a single JSON block in the format you specified, containing a minimally modified test class that compiles and runs cleanly, plus a short note summarizing the fix.
